Eating out can be a great way to enjoy a delicious meal, catch up with friends, or celebrate a special occasion. But, it can also be a challenge to make healthy food choices when dining out. With so many tempting options, it can be difficult to know what to order. This article will provide helpful tips on how to make healthy food choices when eating out.

## Understand the Menu

The first step to making healthy food choices when eating out is to understand the menu. Many restaurants have nutrition information available, so take the time to read it. This will help you make informed decisions about what to order. Additionally, some restaurants offer healthier options such as salads, grilled items, and lean proteins. These are usually lower in calories and fat than fried items.

## Ask Questions

If you don't see nutrition information available, don't be afraid to ask questions. Most restaurants are happy to provide information about their menu items. You can also ask about how the food is prepared. For example, you can ask if the item is grilled, baked, or fried. Knowing how the food is prepared will help you make healthier choices.

## Make Substitutions

Making substitutions is another great way to make healthy food choices when eating out. Many restaurants offer substitutions such as swapping out french fries for a side salad or swapping out a white bun for a whole wheat bun. These small changes can make a big difference in the nutritional value of your meal.

## Choose the Right Portion Size

When eating out, it's important to choose the right portion size. Many restaurants serve large portions, which can lead to overeating. To avoid overeating, you can split an entree with a friend or order an appetizer as your main meal. Additionally, you can ask for a to-go box when your food arrives and put half of your meal away for later.

## Make Healthy Dessert Choices

When it comes to dessert, there are plenty of healthy options. Instead of ordering a slice of cake or a sundae, you can opt for a piece of fresh fruit or a yogurt parfait. These options are lower in calories and fat, but still satisfy your sweet tooth.

Making healthy food choices when eating out doesn't have to be difficult. By understanding the menu, asking questions, making substitutions, choosing the right portion size, and making healthy dessert choices, you can enjoy a delicious and nutritious meal.
