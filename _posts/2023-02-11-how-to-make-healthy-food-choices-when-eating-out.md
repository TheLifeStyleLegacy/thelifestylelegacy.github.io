Eating out can be a great way to enjoy a delicious meal with friends and family. But it can also be a challenge to make healthy food choices when you're not in control of the ingredients or cooking methods. With a few simple tips, you can make healthier choices when eating out and still enjoy a delicious meal.

## Understand the Menu

The first step in making healthy food choices when eating out is to understand the menu. Many restaurants now offer nutrition information on their menus or websites, which can help you make informed decisions. Look for items that are grilled, baked, steamed, or broiled, as these are usually lower in fat and calories than fried items. 

When looking at the menu, look for items that are made with whole grains, such as brown rice, whole wheat pasta, or quinoa. These are usually higher in fiber and other nutrients than white rice or regular pasta. 

## Choose Lean Proteins

When selecting a protein, look for leaner options such as chicken, fish, or tofu. Avoid fried proteins or those that are served with a creamy sauce. If you're ordering a sandwich or wrap, opt for a whole wheat or multigrain bread. 

## Load Up on Veggies

Vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet, so try to fill up on them when eating out. Look for salads with lots of fresh vegetables, or order a side of steamed vegetables. If you're ordering a sandwich or wrap, opt for a veggie-packed option. 

## Watch Your Portions

It's easy to overeat when eating out, so be mindful of portion sizes. Many restaurants serve large portions, so consider splitting a meal with a friend or asking for a to-go box when your meal arrives. 

## Limit Added Sugars and Saturated Fats

When eating out, try to limit added sugars and saturated fats. Look for items that are made with healthy fats, such as olive oil or avocado. Avoid items that are made with butter, cream, or cheese. 

## Make Smart Drink Choices

When it comes to drinks, water is always the best choice. If you're looking for something a bit more exciting, opt for unsweetened tea or sparkling water with a splash of juice. Avoid sugary drinks such as soda, juice, and sweet tea. 

## Enjoy Your Meal

Making healthy food choices when eating out doesn't have to be difficult. With a few simple tips, you can enjoy a delicious and nutritious meal. So go ahead and enjoy your meal, knowing that you're making a smart choice. 

## Summary

Eating out can be a great way to enjoy a delicious meal with friends and family, but it can also be a challenge to make healthy food choices. With a few simple tips, you can make healthier choices when eating out and still enjoy a delicious meal. Look for items that are grilled, baked, steamed, or broiled, choose lean proteins, load up on veggies, watch your portions, limit added sugars and saturated fats, and make smart drink choices. With these tips, you can enjoy a delicious and nutritious meal.
