Eating out can be a great way to enjoy a meal with friends and family, but it can also be a source of unhealthy eating habits. With so many tempting options, it can be difficult to make healthy choices when dining out. Fortunately, there are some simple tips that can help you make healthier choices when eating out.

## Know Your Options

The first step to making healthier choices when eating out is to know your options. Many restaurants offer a variety of dishes, so it’s important to take the time to look at the menu and decide which option is best for you. Consider the ingredients, portion sizes, and nutritional value of each dish before making your decision.

## Choose Lean Proteins

When selecting a main course, opt for lean proteins such as chicken, fish, or tofu. These proteins are lower in saturated fat and cholesterol, and they provide essential nutrients such as iron, zinc, and B vitamins. If you’re looking for a vegetarian option, try a bean-based dish such as a veggie burger or black bean burrito.

## Fill Up on Veggies

Vegetables are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber, so it’s important to fill up on them when eating out. Try to choose dishes that are loaded with vegetables, such as a veggie wrap or stir-fry. If you’re having a sandwich, opt for a veggie-based option such as a veggie burger or portobello mushroom sandwich.

## Watch Your Portions

When eating out, it’s easy to overeat. To avoid overeating, try to stick to smaller portions. Ask for a to-go box when you order, and put half of your meal in the box before you start eating. This will help you monitor your portion sizes and prevent overeating.

## Choose Healthy Sides

When selecting sides, opt for healthier options such as a side salad or steamed vegetables. Avoid fried sides such as french fries or onion rings, as these are high in fat and calories. If you’re having a sandwich, opt for a side of fruit instead of chips.

## Limit Alcohol Intake

Alcoholic beverages can be high in calories and sugar, so it’s important to limit your intake when eating out. If you do choose to drink, opt for a light beer or a glass of wine. Avoid sugary mixed drinks, as these can be loaded with calories.

## Skip Dessert

Desserts can be high in sugar and calories, so it’s best to skip them when eating out. If you’re craving something sweet, opt for a piece of fresh fruit or a small bowl of sorbet.

Making healthier choices when dining out doesn’t have to be difficult. By following these simple tips, you can enjoy a delicious meal without compromising your health.

# Summary

Eating out can be a great way to enjoy a meal with friends and family, but it can also be a source of unhealthy eating habits. Fortunately, there are some simple tips that can help you make healthier choices when eating out. Start by knowing your options, choosing lean proteins, filling up on veggies, watching your portions, choosing healthy sides, limiting alcohol intake, and skipping dessert. With these tips, you can enjoy a delicious meal without compromising your health.
