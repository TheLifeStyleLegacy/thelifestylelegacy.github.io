Sleep is essential for our physical and mental health. It helps us to restore energy, repair cells, and improve our overall wellbeing. Unfortunately, many of us don’t get enough sleep. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in three adults don’t get enough sleep. This can lead to a range of health issues, including increased risk of depression, obesity, heart disease, and stroke.
