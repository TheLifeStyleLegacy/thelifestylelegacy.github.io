Eating out can be a great way to enjoy a meal with friends and family, but it can also be a challenge to make healthy food choices. With so many tempting options, it can be hard to know what to order. Fortunately, there are some simple tips you can follow to make sure you’re making the best choices for your health and wellness. 

## Know Your Options

The first step to making healthy food choices when eating out is to know what your options are. Before you go to a restaurant, take the time to look up their menu online. This will give you a chance to see what healthy options are available and plan ahead. You can also ask your server for suggestions on healthier dishes and sides. 

## Choose Lean Proteins

When ordering your main dish, try to choose lean proteins such as fish, chicken, or tofu. These are typically lower in saturated fat and calories than red meat, and they are also a great source of essential vitamins and minerals. If you’re ordering a burger, opt for a leaner option such as turkey or veggie. 

## Watch Your Portion Sizes

It’s easy to overeat when you’re eating out, so it’s important to be mindful of your portion sizes. Ask your server for a to-go box when your meal arrives and immediately put half of the food away. This will help you avoid overeating and ensure you’re getting the right amount of food. 

## Load Up On Veggies

When ordering sides, try to choose vegetables instead of starchy options such as fries or mashed potatoes. Vegetables are a great source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and they are also low in calories. If you’re ordering a salad, opt for a light dressing on the side or skip it altogether. 

## Avoid Fried Foods

Fried foods are typically high in calories and saturated fat, so it’s best to avoid them when eating out. Instead, opt for grilled, baked, or steamed dishes. These are typically lower in fat and calories and will help you stay on track with your health goals. 

## Skip The Dessert

Desserts are usually loaded with sugar and calories, so it’s best to skip them when eating out. If you’re craving something sweet, opt for a piece of fruit or a small scoop of sorbet. These are lower in calories and will help you satisfy your sweet tooth without going overboard. 

Making healthy food choices when eating out doesn’t have to be difficult. By following these simple tips, you can enjoy a delicious meal without compromising your health. 

# Summary

Eating out can be a great way to enjoy a meal with friends and family, but it can also be a challenge to make healthy food choices. To make sure you’re making the best choices for your health and wellness, it’s important to know your options, choose lean proteins, watch your portion sizes, load up on veggies, avoid fried foods, and skip the dessert. By following these simple tips, you can enjoy a delicious meal without compromising your health.
