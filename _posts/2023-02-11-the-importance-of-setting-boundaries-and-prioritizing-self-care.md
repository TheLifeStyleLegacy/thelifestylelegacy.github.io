**Self-care is essential for our mental and physical health, yet it is often neglected in our busy lives. Setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care can help us to stay healthy and happy.**

We all have busy lives, and it can be difficult to make time for ourselves. We often put our own needs last, and this can lead to burnout, exhaustion, and even physical and mental health problems. It is important to set boundaries and prioritize self-care in order to stay healthy and happy.

## What is Self-Care?

Self-care is any activity that we do to take care of our physical, mental, and emotional health. It can include activities such as exercising, eating healthy, getting enough sleep, meditating, taking time for yourself, and engaging in activities that bring you joy. Self-care is not selfish, it is essential for our wellbeing.

Setting boundaries is important for our mental and physical health. It is important to set boundaries with our time, energy, and resources. We need to be able to say “no” to things that don’t serve us, and to make sure that we are taking care of ourselves first. Setting boundaries can help us to stay focused on our goals and to make sure that we are taking care of our own needs.
