Maintaining a healthy weight is essential for overall health and well-being. It can help prevent a range of health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. It can also help improve your mood and energy levels. Managing your body mass index (BMI) is an important part of maintaining a healthy weight.

## What is BMI?

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It is used to determine whether someone is underweight, overweight, or at a healthy weight. BMI is calculated by dividing a personâ€™s weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.

## How to Calculate BMI

Calculating your BMI is simple. All you need is your height and weight. First, measure your height in meters. Then, measure your weight in kilograms. Finally, divide your weight by your height squared. The resulting number is your BMI.

## What is a Healthy BMI?

A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9. A BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight, and a BMI above 24.9 is considered overweight.

## Benefits of Maintaining a Healthy Weight

Maintaining a healthy weight has many benefits. It can help reduce your risk of developing chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. It can also help improve your mood and energy levels.
