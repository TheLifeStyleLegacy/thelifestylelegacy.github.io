Eating out can be a great way to enjoy a delicious meal with friends and family. But it can also be a challenge to make healthy choices when dining out. With so many tempting options and the convenience of fast food, it can be hard to make the right choices. Fortunately, there are some simple tips that can help you make smart and healthy choices when dining out.

## Understand Your Options 

The first step to making healthy choices when dining out is to understand your options. Many restaurants offer healthy options, such as salads, grilled fish, and lean proteins. Look for restaurants that offer these options and make sure to ask about the ingredients and preparation methods. It's also important to be aware of the portion sizes. Many restaurants serve large portions that can easily add up to more than one serving. 

## Make Smart Substitutions 

When ordering, you can make smart substitutions to make your meal healthier. For example, you can substitute french fries for a side salad or steamed vegetables. You can also ask for sauces and dressings on the side so you can control how much you use. 

## Avoid Unhealthy Ingredients 

When ordering, be aware of unhealthy ingredients that can add extra calories and fat to your meal. Avoid dishes that are fried, creamy, or made with cheese or butter. Instead, look for dishes that are grilled, steamed, or roasted. 

## Watch Your Portions 

It's also important to watch your portion sizes when dining out. Many restaurants serve large portions that can easily add up to more than one serving. To avoid overeating, you can ask for a to-go box and put half of your meal in it before you start eating. 

## Choose Healthy Drinks 

When dining out, it's important to choose healthy drinks. Avoid sugary drinks like soda and juice and opt for water or unsweetened tea instead. You can also choose drinks that are low in calories, such as light beer or wine. 

## Make Smart Choices 

Making smart choices when dining out can help you stay on track with your health and fitness goals. By understanding your options, making smart substitutions, avoiding unhealthy ingredients, watching your portions, and choosing healthy drinks, you can make smart and healthy choices when dining out.
