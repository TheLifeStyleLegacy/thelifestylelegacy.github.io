Patience is essential in any relationship. It is important to be patient with your partner and to give them time to process their thoughts and feelings. Being patient will help to build a strong relationship.

## Be Supportive

Supporting your partner is an important part of any relationship. Show your partner that you are there for them and that you are willing to help them. This will help to build a strong relationship.
