## What is a Food Allergy?

A food allergy is an immune system reaction to a food that the body mistakenly believes is harmful. When a person with a food allergy eats the food, their body releases chemicals such as histamine, which can cause an allergic reaction. Symptoms of a food allergy can range from mild to severe, and can include hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, and anaphylaxis. 

## What is a Food Intolerance?

A food intolerance is a reaction to a food that does not involve the immune system. It is usually caused by an inability to digest certain foods, or by the body's inability to absorb certain nutrients. Symptoms of a food intolerance can include digestive issues such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea, as well as headaches, fatigue, and skin rashes.
