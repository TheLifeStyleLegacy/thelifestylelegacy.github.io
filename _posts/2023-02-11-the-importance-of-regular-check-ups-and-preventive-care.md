It's easy to forget about our health when we're busy with work, school, and family. But regular check-ups and preventive care are essential for maintaining good health and avoiding serious illnesses. Regular check-ups and health screenings can help detect health problems early, when they are easier to treat.

## What is Preventive Care?

Preventive care is any medical service or procedure that is done to prevent illness or detect it early. It includes regular check-ups, health screenings, immunizations, and lifestyle counseling.

Preventive care can help you stay healthy and avoid serious illnesses. It can also help you manage existing health conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes.

Regular check-ups and health screenings can help detect health problems early, when they are easier to treat. For example, a mammogram can help detect breast cancer early, when it is most treatable.

Preventive care can also help you save money. Early detection of health problems can help you avoid costly treatments and hospital stays.

## What Types of Preventive Care Should I Get?
