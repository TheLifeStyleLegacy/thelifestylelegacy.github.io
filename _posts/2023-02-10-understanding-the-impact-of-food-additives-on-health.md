**Food additives** are substances added to food to enhance its flavor, texture, color, or shelf life. While some additives are beneficial, others can have a negative impact on our health. In this article, we will explore the potential health risks associated with food additives and how to identify them.

## What Are Food Additives?

Food additives are substances added to food to enhance its flavor, texture, color, or shelf life. Common food additives include preservatives, flavorings, colorings, sweeteners, emulsifiers, and stabilizers. These additives are used to improve the taste and appearance of food, as well as to extend its shelf life.

## Potential Health Risks of Food Additives

To identify food additives, look for words such as “preservative,” “flavoring,” “coloring,” “sweetener,” “emulsifier,” or “stabilizer.” Additionally, some food additives may be listed by their chemical names, such as “sodium benzoate” or “monosodium glutamate.”

## Conclusion

Food additives can have a negative impact on our health, so it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with them. To identify food additives, look for words such as “preservative,” “flavoring,” “coloring,” “sweetener,” “emulsifier,” or “stabilizer.” Additionally, some food additives may be listed by their chemical names. 

By understanding the potential health risks associated with food additives, we can make more informed decisions about the foods we eat.
