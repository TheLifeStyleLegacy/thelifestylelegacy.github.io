**Self-esteem is an important part of a child's development, and it's important for parents to help foster healthy self-esteem in their children.** Self-esteem is how a person feels about themselves and their abilities, and it can have a big impact on how a child interacts with the world around them. Low self-esteem can lead to feelings of worthlessness, depression, and anxiety, while high self-esteem can help children feel confident and secure. 

As a parent, it's important to understand how to promote healthy self-esteem in your children. Here are some tips for helping your children develop healthy self-esteem:
