Eating out is a great way to enjoy a delicious meal without having to do the cooking or the cleaning. But it can be hard to make healthy restaurant choices when you're out and about. With so many tempting options, it can be difficult to make the right decisions. But don't worry, we've got you covered! In this article, we'll provide you with some tips for eating out and making healthy restaurant choices. 

## Know Your Options 

Before you even step foot in a restaurant, it's important to know what options are available. Many restaurants now offer healthier options, such as salads, grilled fish, and lean proteins. Take the time to look at the menu before you go and decide what you'll order ahead of time. This will help you avoid making an impulse decision that you may regret later. 

## Choose the Right Appetizers 

Appetizers can be a great way to start off a meal, but they can also be a source of hidden calories. Fried appetizers, such as mozzarella sticks and onion rings, are usually high in fat and calories. Instead, opt for healthier options like vegetable platters, hummus, or grilled shrimp. 

## Go for the Greens 

Salads are a great way to get your daily dose of vegetables. Opt for salads with lots of colorful vegetables and a light dressing. Avoid creamy dressings, which are usually high in fat and calories. If you're looking for a heartier option, try a grilled chicken or salmon salad. 

## Choose Lean Proteins 

When it comes to proteins, it's best to choose lean options such as grilled chicken, fish, or tofu. Avoid fried proteins, which are usually high in fat and calories. If you're looking for a vegetarian option, opt for beans or lentils. 

## Skip the Sides 

Sides can be a great way to add flavor and texture to a meal, but they can also be a source of hidden calories. French fries, mashed potatoes, and macaroni and cheese are usually high in fat and calories. Instead, opt for healthier sides such as steamed vegetables, a side salad, or a piece of fruit. 

## Watch Your Portions 

When eating out, it's easy to overeat. To avoid overeating, try to stick to smaller portions. Most restaurants serve large portions, so it's best to split a meal with a friend or take half of it home. 

## Drink Water 

Drinking water is a great way to stay hydrated and fill up on a meal. Avoid sugary drinks, such as soda and juice, which are usually high in calories. If you're looking for something with a bit more flavor, opt for sparkling water or unsweetened iced tea. 

## Enjoy Yourself 

Eating out should be an enjoyable experience. Don't be too hard on yourself if you make a few unhealthy choices. Just remember to make healthier choices the next time you go out. 

Making healthy restaurant choices doesn't have to be difficult. With a few simple tips, you can enjoy a delicious meal without feeling guilty. So next time you're out, remember these tips and make the right decisions.
