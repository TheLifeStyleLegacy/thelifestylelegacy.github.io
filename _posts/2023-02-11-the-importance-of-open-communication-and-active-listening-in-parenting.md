Parenting is one of the most important roles we can take on in life. It is a job that requires patience, understanding and communication. Open communication and active listening are two of the most important tools a parent can use to ensure their children are growing up in a healthy and supportive environment. This article will explore the importance of open communication and active listening in parenting, and how these two skills can help create a strong bond between parent and child.

## What is Open Communication?

Open communication is a form of communication between two or more people that is honest, direct, and without any hidden agendas. It is a way of expressing oneself without fear of judgement or criticism. Open communication allows for a free flow of ideas, opinions, and feelings between people, which can lead to a better understanding of each other.

## What is Active Listening?

Active listening is an important communication skill that involves listening to what someone is saying and responding in a way that shows you understand and empathize with them. It involves being present and engaged in the conversation, and being able to pick up on subtle cues and body language. Active listening is an important skill for any parent, as it helps to build trust and understanding between parent and child.
